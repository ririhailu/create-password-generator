 # create-password-generator

## Description

For this project we had to generate the password by creating random characters. Based on the user answers to given questions, it will determine their password. It will ask the user if they want to add any special characters, numeric, lowercase, or uppercase. The function was created within the JavaScript. The CSS contained the codes to style the appeal of the site. The HTML contained the elements to form the overall page. 

## Installation

The create-password-generator was first created in repository in GitHub. The repository was cloned into local desktop. The index.html file was created and pushed into repository GitHub. Any changes made to local was added, committed and pushed to repository. 

## Credits

I would like to thank Alexis Gonzalez and Mike G. for assisting me with this project.
